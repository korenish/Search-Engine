**Few notes for the serch**
1. The output path needs to contain the output path used for pre-proccessing the corpus (or wherever the output files are stored).
2. If the ipnut path will not contain a directory with "5 stop_words" file, the stop words that will be taken into account are the words from the original file.
3. When running with semantically similar words: it is *not necessary* to have a working internet connection, but it is recommended for better results (The program 
will try to use a semantically similar word search that requires internet connection, and if that fails it will use  a method which does not require internet connection ,
which from our tests gives less good results).




Enjoy!
